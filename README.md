# ClusterBurden

## Rare variant association using both positional (variant amino acid residue clustering) and burden signals - with control for uneven coverage.

### Relevance of method:
This method is designed for case-control studies where the condition under investigation is caused by rare missense variants in protein-coding regions. This covers many Mendelian/rare diseases. When a simple burden test does not yield significant associations, consideration of clustering information can increase power to detect low penetrance undiscovered disease-genes.
